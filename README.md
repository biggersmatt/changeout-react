# Change Out
Most grocery stores have a two week advertising schedule. At the end of the two weeks, all Endcaps and Flanks change in the store to better match that period's sale items.
  - An Endcap is the end section between two aisles.
  - A Flank is side shelfing at the end of an aisle but before the Endcap.

This application provides a clean, dynamic UI for any store to use to help facilitate a smoother transition between advertising cycle and clear communication to employees what is and is not changing.

#### Unsolved Problems
* New rotation order on a Drag and Drop is not stored in the Database.
* Deleting a Flank from an Endcap sets that Endcaps Flank to 'null' preventing creation of a new Flank in it's place afterwards
* The Promo Month and Period do not store in the database and on refresh, reset

<hr />

#### Future Features
* Creation of a User Model
* Login / Auth
