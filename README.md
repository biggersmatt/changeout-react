 # Change Out
Most grocery stores have a two week advertising schedule. At the end of the two weeks, all Endcaps and Flanks change in the store to better match that period's sale items.
  - An Endcap is the end section between two aisles.
  - A Flank is side shelfing at the end of an aisle but before the Endcap.

This application provides a clean, dynamic UI for any store to use to help facilitate a smoother transition between advertising cycle and clear communication to employees what is and is not changing.
